1. Land Name: Bikini Bottom
   Land Members: Jarrison (Liam Stacy), Vlad (Vlad Muresan), Blossom (Emelyn Pak)

2. Midterm Project / Enter The Park

3. This program implements 3D characters that can be individually controlled to walk throughout our world. There are also 3 different camera models implemented so that the world can be 
   viewed from different perspectives. Different types of illumination are also displayed. 

4. - Character Movement:
   	WASD = Jarrison
   	TFGH = Vlad
   	IJKL = Blossom

   - Camera Toggling:
   	C = Switch which character the arcball and first person camera are focused on
   	1 = Toggle between free cam and arcball cam
   	2 = Toggle the first person cam
   
   - Arcball Controls: 
	Left-Click + Drag = move camera angle
	Ctrl + Left-Click + Drag = Drag up zooms out, drag down zooms in

   - Free Cam Controls: 
   	Space = zoom in
	X = zoom out
	Arrow up, down, left, right = controls free cam angles

5. New objects.hpp file included in zip. Must include this in CSCI441 folder. No other unique compiling instructions.

6. Spotlight does not light up the ground correctly but it lights up our characters. When the lights are added together, it is difficult to see each light individually.

7. Pair programmed for 90% of the time.
   Individually refactored our own characters to fit within the program.
   Liam: refactored code for optimization, driver for setting up camera models, and driver for part of the light models
   Emelyn: fixed part of character movement, driver for creation of picture-in-picture model, driver for part of the light models
   Vlad: driver for part of the light models, implementing character movement, creating video
